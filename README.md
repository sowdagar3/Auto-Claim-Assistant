# Car Damage Detection for Insurance Claims

## Overview
This repository contains the machine learning project developed during the Hackathon conducted by **Ripik.AI**. This project aims to streamline the process of filing car insurance claims by automatically classifying types of car damage using machine learning. By analyzing images of car damage, the model predicts categories such as cracks, scratches, flat tires, dents, glass shattering, and broken lamps.  

## Project Objectives
- To assist insurance companies in automating the damage assessment process.
- To provide a fair, consistent, and swift insurance claim experience.
- To reduce the time and cost of manual car damage inspection.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images of car damages typically involved in insurance claims. The images are preprocessed and augmented to create a balanced dataset using SMOTE for training the machine learning model.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.10
- TensorFlow==2.14.0
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- imblearn
