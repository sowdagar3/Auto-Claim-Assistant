# Car Damage Detection for Insurance Claims

## Overview
This repository contains the machine learning project developed during the Hackathon conducted by **Ripik.AI**. This project aims to streamline the process of filing car insurance claims by automatically classifying types of car damage using machine learning. By analyzing images of car damage, the model predicts categories such as cracks, scratches, flat tires, dents, glass shattering, and broken lamps.  

## Project Objectives
- To assist insurance companies in automating the damage assessment process.
- To provide a fair, consistent, and swift insurance claim experience.
- To reduce the time and cost of manual car damage inspection.

## Problem Statement

In the insurance industry, processing claims for vehicle damage is a common and most essential task. With the advancement in AI and Computer Vision, the users can settle the claims online instantly by uploading the images of the damaged car with the insurance company.  

Now, insurance companies face the constant challenge of identifying fraudulent claims. It's a common practice for the users to submit the fraudulent images as a part of the claim settlement process. This brings out the threat/challenge to the insurance companies to identify the fraudulent claims which leads to significant financial losses.  

Fraudulent claims often involve exaggerating the extent of damage or submitting false claims altogether. In this problem, we will focus on the first type of problem i.e. exaggerating the extent of damage. To mitigate these losses and maintain the integrity of their operations, insurance companies must develop effective methods to flag out these claims most accurately and efficiently.    

The hackathon challenges to develop a robust and high performance model for classifying an image of a car into different types of damages automatically with the help of computer vision techniques. By accurately identifying the damages, the insurance company can assess the legitimacy of the claim and make informed decisions regarding payouts.  

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images of car damages typically involved in insurance claims. The images are preprocessed and augmented to create a balanced dataset using SMOTE for training the machine learning model.
